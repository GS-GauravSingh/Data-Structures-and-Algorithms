    /* Question: There are a total of N tasks, labeled from 0 to N-1. Some tasks may have prerequisites, for example to do task 0 you have to first complete task 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0, 1]
    Given the total number of tasks N and a list of prerequisite pairs P, find if it is possible to finish all tasks.

    Example 1:
    Input:
    N = 4, P = 3
    prerequisites = {{1,0},{2,1},{3,2}}
    Output:
    Yes
    Explanation:
    To do task 1 you should have completed
    task 0, and to do task 2 you should
    have finished task 1, and to do task 3 you
    should have finished task 2. So it is possible.
    */

    /* Intution: The questions state that the given pairs signify the dependencies of tasks.

    For example, the pair {0, 1} signifies that to perform task 0, first we need to complete task 1. So basically task 0 is dependent on task 1.

    Now, if we consider this pair of tasks as nodes, like u = 0 and v = 1. Now the pair would look like this {u, v}. Now, I can say the to perform task 'u', first I need to complete task 'v'.

    And I can say that there is a directed edge from node 'v' to 'u' (v -> u), because to perform task 'u', first I need to complete task 'v'. Similarly first we need to "perform or print or visit" "task or node" 'v', only then we can move toward the node 'u'.

    Now, this entire problem becomes a graph problem.

    Now, letâ€™s analyze the examples from the graph point of view:

    For example 1, the number of tasks(considered as nodes) is 4, and pairs(considered as edges) are 3. If we draw the graph accordingly, the following illustration is produced:

    Graph (DAG):        3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0

    And For example 2, the number of tasks(considered as nodes) is 4, and pairs(considered as edges) are 4. If we draw the graph accordingly, the following illustration is produced:

    Graph:        1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3   (Directed Cyclic Graph).
                  ^         |
                  |         |
                  -----------
    Analyzing the graphs, we can conclude that performing all the tasks from the first set is possible because the first graph does not contain any cycle but as the second graph contains a cycle, performing all the tasks from the second set is impossible(there exists a cyclic dependency between the tasks).

    So, if a graph is directd acyclic graph then we can say that it is possible to finish all the tasks otherwise if the graph is not a DAG then it is not possible to finish all the tasks.

    Using Kanh's Algorithm we can easily find out whether a graph is DAG or not.
