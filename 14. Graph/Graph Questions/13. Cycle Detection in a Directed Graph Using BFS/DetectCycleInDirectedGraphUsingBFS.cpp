    /* Intuition:

    1. Since we know topological sorting is only possible for directed acyclic graphs(DAGs), if we apply Kahnâ€™s algorithm in a directed cyclic graph(A directed graph that contains a cycle), it will fail to find the topological sorting(i.e. The final sorting will not contain all the nodes or vertices).

    2. So, finally, we will check the sorting to see if it contains all V vertices or not. If the result does not include all V vertices, we can conclude that there is a cycle.

    Note: The intuition is to check the size of the final topological sorting if it equals V(no. of vertices or nodes) or not.
